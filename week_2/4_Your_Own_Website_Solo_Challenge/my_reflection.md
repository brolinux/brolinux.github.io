My Website url: <!-- Website URL here (remove comment) -->

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned that designing for the web can be a highly creative endevour. It may seem that many webistes are alike, but really once a person begins to break them down and analyze, differences emerge. The needs of a webiste's visitors are to some degree unique and web designers must anser those needs with design and code (function).

Seeing the grid in action is very helpful. I have't grasped how to implement the grid into my code, looks like it would take a while to learn. I haven't grasped the concept of the 960 grid. But it looks interesting.

As far as "fun" working on my site, it isn't completed yet. I still need to add media queries but it was challenge to get done. It still doesn't look like it's there yet, but I will continue to pour time into getting it to size properly. The wireframe was very helpful in the initial stages, since I worked out the size each box needed to be in the parent container. 
I deviated from the wireframe at the very end, when I got the idea of adding a pic and some text below.

Super cool thing in responsive would be the nth child selector. The idea that a line can be broken on a child of my choosing is so helful.
I thought the css track on treehouse was very helpful in showing how the responsivenes is brought to life in the code.
I got a lot out of watching their tutorial and also from this site:http://css-tricks.com.
