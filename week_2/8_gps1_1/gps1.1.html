        <p>Pair Programming is essential at DBC's Phase 0 for all students. It solidifies the concept
        group collaboration, which is at the core of any professional development experience.

When more than one developer is working on a project, it is easy for them 
to interpret the requirements differently or create conflicting 
implementations.  When they are pair programming, they are constantly 
collaborating on what and how to code so they come away with the same 
understanding of what needs to be done, especially when working separately 
later on.</p>

 <p class="par" id="par2"><span class="opener">Promote Listening</span><br />
It is easy for one developer's ideas to dominate when coding a project.  
By programming in pairs and allowing one developer to provide direction 
while the other codes,that ensures that both developers' thoughts on the 
project are considered.</p>

 <p class="par" id="par3"><span class="opener">Promote Independent Thinking</span><br />
Without the discrete separation of driver and navigator roles, it's 
possible for developers to fall into a follower role where they defer 
their opinion to other developers.  Splitting the responsibilities 
between drivers and navigators and the dialog it creates prevents 
developers from passing over opportunities of providing their input.</p>

 <p class="par" id="par4"><span class="opener">Mirrors Professional Development Environments</span><br />
Large projects require multiple developers and multiple developers 
need coordination.  In these cases, it is necessary work together on 
programming for all the other reasons discussed.  Therefore this method 
of development is used in the professional environment to ensure quality 
work among more than one developer when several large parts of the project 
are in motion.</p>

 <p class="par">This exercise was a first of its kind for me. I've never worked remotely online with other people so this was exciting and a bit scary. Overall, my pairing worked out nicely. <br />We met for the first time on GPS 1.1 and then the touched base the following day delegating some tasks - Ian wrote the copy I provided the wireframe. From there we met again the following day and sealed the deal with CSS. <br />
 I need to be better at being a driver, because I have a natural tendency to want to navigate as well, which is confusing for us both since we need to know how to carry out our roles. I'm so used to working alone on the concept, design and coding, that being in a team and being asked to type is something new. Overall, this was a fun little exercise in pairing and getting to know people in other time zones and getting to a final result that we agreed upon. We did run into issues with the image not sizing with the window size, even after we gave it a width of 100%. But that was the only issue we ran into.</p>
