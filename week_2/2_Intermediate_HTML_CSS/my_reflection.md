# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Web Standards a good to have they provide clear guidelines for the developers on what to deliver the webiste to get it to look right. However, with IE, for example, disregarding the progress the others have made, web standards become very difficult to accomodate. Beyond not adopting certain rules, when browser manufacturers do make them, they sometimes require unique syntax in the css. It's a bit maddening keeping up with all the individual ways of rendering something. I wish companies would put profits aside and learn to work in step with each other's progress and adopt the changes in a cohesive unified way.
Structure makes a lot of sense, I especially like how HTML5 had added new tags that give the page added structure.

It's important to reset our CSS styles due to each client having a unique way of rendering elements on the page. Some clients take the liberty of adding borders, or padding or margins to the page. By resetting these to zero, we are handing all the controls back to the designer.

I have used the major 4 browsers, with IE being the one I least enjoy. I'm nostalgic for Firefox so I use that browser a lot with Chrome a second popular one.
As far as resources go, I always turn to stack overflow for any code debugging issue. IE is very frustrating to work with. I have all but given up on IE 7 which seems to still be in existence after all this time.
