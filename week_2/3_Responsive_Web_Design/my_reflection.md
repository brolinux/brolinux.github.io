# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
 

Responsive ensures that we create one website that matches any screen size of any device. 
By tweaking the size values on the page, responsive sites can deliver to anyone and make everyone feel equally valued as a site visitor.
It's a matter of recognizing that every visitor is valued by the company regardless of technilogical means.

Smart phones have impacted the way technology is delivered, they are outpacing PC sales and will be the future main source of technology consumption globally. Things have been customized for mobility and portability, not static, heavy machinary sitting on ac desk somewhere.

The visually impaired use sofware that reads  pages aload. Technology such as SIRI takes voice commands. These features are gradually being used by non-visually impaired people. Advances for one group of users can advance the way everyone consumes technology in the future. If a company can afford the R&D in catering to one group they definitely should, who knows where their research may lead.

It seems to me that very logical thinking people deal in web development. So far I haven't encountered something that didn't make sense. In the past when something didn't make sense to me it was because a tech company put innovation for the sake of innovation before usability and functionality. Like MS WINDOWS 8. That didn't make sense to me. From the little I've learned about the web, it appears to be sensible. I did hear one web developer speak about how crazy it is to use HTML for things it was never meant to be used for, like turning on the lights in your house on/off. Coders have to go around the limitaions of HTML [which is very limited] to get the page to do things its forefathers never imagined it would be used for.
