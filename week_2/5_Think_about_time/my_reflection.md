* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My biggest time challenge is the fact that I work full time. If I didn't work full time and could devote myself wholely to DBC I think the stress and pressure and sheer marathon-driven mind set I have at the moment would disappear. But for now, it is a marathon to get to the finish line by week's end. It's not easy, but I knew what I was signing up for.
This week was especially not ideal for learning, due t Memorial Day weekend when my roommates threw a all day/all night party and I had to find alternate accommodations and still make the deadline in time.
Hopefully, yhings will quiet down soon...unitl July 4 weekend.

Hi Everyone,
Getting around to last odds and ends of this week's challenges...Here is what i wrote on Time MNGT:

To combat the stress I allow myself an hour a day to destress...watch TV, read a book or magazine article and do something that has nothing at all to do with DBC, websites internet, databases...During this time I exist inside a bubble and it's helps me escape the pressure. I watched the meditation video DBC put up on Vimeo. I think I'll start doing that too. I have never meditated before.

Techniques to combat stress, apart from mentally disengaging from the material mentally is also to disengage physically. Get up, splash some water on my face. Moving around and taking my eyes off the computer screen.

Generally speaking, I plan to scale back the number of days I work if I find that the work load at DBC is getting harder to bear. I will scale back on "bubble" time (watching TV or reading a book, magazine article, going on tumblr, ect.). DBC is more important at the moment, and it's temporary. I can always catch up on TV, magazines later.
