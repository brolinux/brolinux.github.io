* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?

The DOM makes a lot of sense. It breaks the page into a heirarchacal order, by top most element down to parent/child relationships on the page. There are ways to select the element and every element's child on the page.
I only know that DOM is powerful. Capable of making style changes and even content changes to the page. It adds actions and a bit more life to the page.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

The wordpress selectors appear to all reference "wp" in their name somewhere. The divs, the classes all named with wp in them. But because I created my page, I named my divs and classes shorter and more personal names.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

Chrome Dev Tools is very helpful. I wasn't previously aware how to use the Network panel. It seems to be a Swiss Army Knife of sorts, that I only know how to use 3/10 of. Eager to learn more tutorials on Dev Tools.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Learning about the speed of the page download and being able to focus only on the photos was an a-ha feature. I knew about selecting the HTML/CSS before today. But I remember the first time I encountered the tool it was one giant a-ha moment after the next.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I went on Google's documentation on Dev Tools to read brief how-tos on topics. I watched unhelpful Youtube videos, too.
