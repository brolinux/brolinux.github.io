<span class="title">Visual Thinkers</span>

<br />

<p>After taking the test I came out as a visual thinker, though I think that as a heavy radio listener I also learn through listening and writing things down, as well as drawing them out on the page.</p>
<br />
<p>Some habits of visual thikers are:
	<ul>
		<li>Organizing the information into groups by the order they unfold on the page.</li>
		<li>Drawing the information to better see the link between tasks and events.</li>
		<li>Wording mini essays to ourselves of what events mean and how they unfold.</li>
		<li>Generally speaking...What aids in seeing processes big and bold and simplified.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<br />
<p>Visual thinkers need to feel they can visualize the problem before coming up with a solution.
The graphical interface we create on paper becomes a map to the solution.</p>
<p>I definitely catch myself scribbling something down next to a note I took, just to ensure it's really <span class="ital">in</span> there. I'm always grateful an article had a chart or a graph to support its basis. I like pictures and visual guides next to long blocks of text. All this is helpful, but not absolutely necessary.
