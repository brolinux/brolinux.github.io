* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  

I asked myself what was DBC asking me to do. I needed to answer the objectives of the challenge: Creating a page with the necessary divs, padding, pseudo-classes and such. I took my previous html page and enhanced it. I did go online to visit http://www.w3schools.com/ just to brush up on some style selectors.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  

I tried to "position: absolute" the footer, and it didn't work out. I left it as is. I really wanted the footer to stick to the bottom of any window...Perhaps I will ask on google+ community about that.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?

I learned there is a tag called <caption> but from what I see online it is used only in refrence to <table> tags.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 

I enjoyed it. I enjoyed going ridiculously large on the pseudo classes for the links. It's a bit fun creating a site where visuals aren't the primary focus.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

I enjoyed putting all the pieces together, divs, headers et al.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I found picking the colors and images a little more time consuming. I went on https://kuler.adobe.com for help on colors. Blue is one of my favorite colors.
