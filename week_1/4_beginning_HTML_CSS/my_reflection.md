* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 

Many of the internal body tags make sense, but when it comes to declaring the doc type I'm still a little uncertain as to what precisely it means, I just follow as I'm told. If it renders correctly on the page and the server is happy, that is all that matters at the end of the day.

* What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML is powerful, but I wish it did more. I wish it could speak to the server, and the database. I wish it could make pages more dynamic instead of being so static. HTML also needs CSS to look good. HTML is also at the mercy of the myriad of browsers out there and things have to marked up correctly and given the proper CSS to ensure browsers don't take liberties with the display of the page.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I'm still getting my head around responsive and mobile first markup, display and approach.
Having a lot of "aha"s regarding HTML5s new tags, such as <address> and <tel>.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
