Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?


Writing on why I love the New York Times web site came easily to me. I have designed webistes in the past, and while a student at FIT I attended a discussion by the top designers who came to speak at at FIT one evening.
They went through a while host of considerations for the NYT.com site, from helping people customize their preferred front size to optimal fonts and weights om the page.
The designers for the NYT are quite brilliant and very considerate of their audience which is very diverse with diverse needs.
I have followed their design over the many years and find everything they do to be sensible, functional and pretty.
