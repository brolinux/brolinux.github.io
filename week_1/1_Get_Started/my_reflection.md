* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

I struggled a lot at first. The idea of remotely speaking through git to github is murky at first. I watched a lot of tutorials online.

* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 

Git is locally tracking changes on my machine and needs no internet access to do this. However, Github relies on internet and relies on my internally installed git to read the changes. Togther they speak to one another.

* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.

Github is needed for big projects that cannot be driven by one person. A team contributes to the project and therefore it's important for eveyone to be able to pick up where the other left off and have most up to date files.

* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?

So far I'm struggling with understanding the which command is responsible for what...And I'm afraid of wiping out what I've already done with a wrong command. Developers work in teams and need to pass files around between coders, Github is that platform for file sharing and version control.

* What doesn't make sense? What does?

In time I Git/Guthub will make all the sense in the world. But right now I still don't know how to revert to a previous version of the file. I understand forking, but synching to the main branch is still not clear to me. I just folllow instruction and get the correct result.
