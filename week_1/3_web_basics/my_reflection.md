* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?

The web and the internet are not the same thing. Apps vs sites. I often wondered why people would say app and not site, and now I know that apps are more active and susceptible to updates than websites.

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?

It's important to declare an HTML page with the proper declaration type. Also opening and closing tags is very important.
Header and Head tags are not the same. The body tag is where the content displayed on the page is placed.

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?

The first time I made a web page was a few years ago, it was super simple, maybe had "Hello World!" written in it. I was elated to see ;D. Today, I make (very) simple html/css pages all the time, I never get as excited as when I first saw that initial HTML page.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

I know how to make simple html/css pages, but I don't understand the whole back-end of the web. I found those parts to be informative.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Not for this section. Though, starting out in html/css, I found Elizabeth Castro's html/css book super helpful.
