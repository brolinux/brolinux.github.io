Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

Hello July Group,
I'm in the NYC July group, my name is Ariel.
I've learned a lot from reading other people's blog posts, how to set the files up and a general understanding of what to write in them. It feels comforting to know others are facing the same fears as I am...I don't know any Javascript, so my fear factor is high!
This week's work load has been heavy, but if this is what it takes to get into DBC so be it!
I've bought a Mac for DBC. I am reading books about Intro to Javascript and saying goodbye to a lot of old habits.
It's demanding, it feels endless but there is a light at the end of the tunnel!
I just have to stick to it. It's not easy at all.
