// My role in the group is: to tell a story and pass it to 2nd member

// Here is my part of the challenge:

The Story:

I want to create two sets of numbers and call these sets by two unique names;
I want one set to be known as "oddLengthArray" and have the number elements 1,2,3,4,5,5,7 be assigned to it;
I want another set to be known as "evenLengthArray" and have the number elements 4,4,5,5,6,6,6,7 be assigned to it;

********************************

Create a function called "assert" which equals three unique pieces of information inside of it;
The function "assert" needs to equal three place holders with specific labels:
1. The mathematical outcome to a series of calculations that we will run in a test, we can label this place holder "test";
2. A worded sentence, we can label this place holder "message";
3. The numerical order of the test that's being run, we can label this place holder "test_number";

If the answer in the test is an incorrect answer, I want an three pieces of information to appear on the screen:
1. The number of the test taken or "test_number"; 
2. The word "false" next to the "test_number";
3. The word "Error:" with a worded sentence which we earlier said would be labeled "message";


If the answer given is correct two pieces of information need to appear on the screen:
1. The number of the test taken, or "test_number";
2. The word "true" next to it;

********************************
********************************
The 1st test to run through assert is a test called "sum", all three values need to be placed inside their repsective place holders inside assert:
1. sum needs to calculate a mathematic problem of adding all the numbers inside a set, where the final answer appears in the function assert under the value "test";
2. sum's worded sentence, message, is "sum should be a Function." this message needs to run through assert under the term "message";
3. This is test number 1. The value 1 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".

The 2nd test assert runs will take the calculations of sum and run it for the values inside the set "oddLengthArray" returning three pieces of information:
1. sum's test result for set "oddLengthArray" should be number 27;
2. The message for this test is "sum should return the sum of all elements in an array with an odd length." this message needs to run through assert under the place 

holder "message";
3. This is test number 2. The value 2 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".


The 3rd test assert runs will take the calculations of sum and run it for the values inside the set "evenLengthArray" returning three pieces of information:
1. sum's test result for set "evenLengthArray" should be number 43;
2. The message for this test is "sum should return the sum of all elements in an array with an even length." this message needs to run through assert under the 

place holder "message";
3. This is test number 3. The value 3 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".

********************************
********************************


The 4th test to run through assert is a test called "mean", all three values need to be placed inside their repsective place holders inside assert:
1. mean calculates the mathematic mean of a set of numbers,the result of which appears in the function assert under the value "test";.
2. means's message is "mean should be a Function." this message needs to run through assert under the term "message";
3. This is test number 4. The value 4 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".


The 5th test assert runs will take the calculations of mean and run it for the values inside the set "oddLengthArray" returning three pieces of information:
1. mean's test result for set "oddLengthArray" should be number 3.857142857142857;
2. The message for this test is "mean should return the average of all elements in an array with an odd length." this message needs to run through assert under the 

place holder "message";
3. This is test number 5. The value 5 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".


The 6th test assert runs will take the calculations of mean and run it for the values inside the set "evenLengthArray" returning three pieces of information:
1. mean's test result for set "evenLengthArray" should be number 5.375;
2. The message for this test is "mean should return the average of all elements in an array with an odd length." this message needs to run through assert under the 

place holder "message";
3. This is test number 6. The value 6 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".


********************************
********************************

The 7th test to run through assert is a test called "median", all three values need to be placed inside their repsective place holders inside assert:
1. median calculates the mathematic median of a set of numbers,the result of which appears in the function assert under the value "test";.
2. median's message is "median should be a Function." this message needs to run through assert under the term "message";
3. This is test number 7. The value 7 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".


The 8th test assert runs will take the calculations of median and run it for the values inside the set "oddLengthArray" returning three pieces of information:
1. median's test result for set "oddLengthArray" should be number 4;
2. The message for this test is "median should return the median value of all elements in an array with an odd length." this message needs to run through assert 

under the place holder "message";
3. This is test number 8. The value 8 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".


The 9th test assert runs will take the calculations of mean and run it for the values inside the set "evenLengthArray" returning three pieces of information:
1. median's test result for set "evenLengthArray" should be number 5.5;
2. The message for this test is "median should return the median value of all elements in an array with an even length.", this message needs to run through assert 

under the place holder "message";
3. This is test number 9. The value 9 needs to appear inside assert under the label "test_number".

Reflection:
This was very challenging for me, since the code was virtually unreadable for the first 45 minutes I looked at it.
I tried to understand whatever English word I saw in the code and make sense of it

However, after a very close examination of the code it became apparent that this code was looking to find the results to mathematical equations that appeared inside of a function.
I had to see what "instanceof" meant, it wasn't immediately apparent that the functions the group would create had also had to run through the assert function at the top.

I was person number 1 and it took me about 4 hours just to write the story. Just coming up with words anyone could understand and at the same time trying to explain it to myself, took many tries and re-edits.
Looking back now, if I had to do this again, it would take me far less time.

The part of the challenge I enjoyed was at the end when things came together and clicked and fit together.
The whole challenge was super tedious. As I wrestled with the code I realized what i initially thought was true had to be scrapped and re-written.
When I looked at what my group did it seemed to be so efficient and succinct. They worked on it so quickly, too. I handed my work on Thursday and by Friday evening the challenge was done.
