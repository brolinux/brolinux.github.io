## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
- Fetch changes
- Commit locally

## Release 5: Errors you encountered
1. Error
<<<<<<< HEAD

You asked to pull from the remote '--all', but did not specify
a branch. Because this is not the default configured remote
for your current branch, you must specify a branch on the command line.

2. Solution

I went to stack overflow and saw that I needed a reset and now it's up to date

3. Cause (explain the error)

I needed to tell Git to pull from master, I hadn't specified the origin in my original $ got pull --all
## Release 6: Reflection

Still confised but I feel the more I use it and the more I go on Stack Overflow I understand a bit more. So far I have git on my main iMac at home and my Linux laptop. Both are synched this account on Github so I get to use it a lot and make errors all the time and fix them.
