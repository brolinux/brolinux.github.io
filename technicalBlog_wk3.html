<span class="title">Love and Loathing in JavaScript Land</span>

<br />

<p>Javascript can be a force for good in web development. A fact that was overlooked for years in the web development world, until recently...</p>
<br />
<p>It’s easy to understand why JavaScript would be embraced since it’s client-side, making its response time lightning fast (compared to anything a server would do). Programmers brought up on C / C++ could easily make the jump to JS’s syntax and make light-weight applications that run on the client’s end, with or without a working internet.</p>
<br />
<p>Because JS’s language has roots in C it can easily run on any computer’s operating system, making it platform-independent, and become readily available for programmers to tinker with, improve and contribute to.</p>
<br />
<p>JavaScript became a built-in feature in the two major browsers of the early internet days, Netscape and Internet Explorer.  In its early days, JS was used to give the page graphical enhancements, such as flashing colors, and open new browser windows, often without approval. Users could turn JavaScript off and disable it at will in their browser prefrences to avoid these annoyances. However, annoyances became dangers when, in the early days of the internet [and today], JavaScript was abused by some and made to deliver malware to the user’s computer. People were warned not to venture to unknown sites, disable JavaScript on their browser and not accept any third-party cookies, as these were all seen as carrying security risks associated with JavaScript’s ability to intrude into the user’s browser and collect/track sensitive data. JavaScript’s embrace of Global variables are blamed for the ease of such security attacks.</p>
<br />
<p>Due to its relatively loosely written style, people who learned C and C++ could easily write what they wanted, how ever they wanted without regard to strict rules of programming. This can make for easily personalized, hard to follow “spaghetti” script.  Mistakes aren’t easily caught in loosely written languages and this can make for large programs spanning many lines that are difficult to debug and follow syntactically.</p>
<br />
<p>Still, JavaScript has prevailed, in part because of Google's development of V8, a fast and efficient JavaScript engine. New and better ibraries were written in JavaScript, such as jQuery, whcih could deliver fast, light-weight results. Frameworks have mushroomed for Javascript not just to deliver fast and responsive webistes, but to deliver fast results for online games, such as Phaser. </p>
