<h2>The New York Times (NYT)</h2>

The NYT.com site needs to present a lot of news to the viewer. It does this in a very neat and spaced-out design. I reallly like the way they add visual queues to the page. Thumbnails, icons, bigger headline text.
The NYT allows visually impaired people to enjoy their site. <br />
Also, when printing an article they use another stylishness that strips the page of the ads and such, and delivers only the important content on the page saving ink. <br />
NYT also places its logo at the top left corner of the screen making navigation super easy. Links are easy accessible which small article captions for the big stories. <br />
I never lost on their site.

<h2>Victrias Secret (VS)</h2>

<br />
This is an online retailer selling their brand of clothing to their customer. VS knows who their prime customer is, and can more easily reach that person.  <br />
VS has full control over how they want to show their brand and what they their customer to see on the page. <br />
VS uses a lot of visuals to sell women's garments. Photos to sell active wear, intimates, swimming.<br />
Their top navigation is devoted to categories such as shoes and clothing.<br />
This website is all about selling, moving merchandise and show casing it. They do it beautifully and make it look so easy.

<h2>Zappos</h2>

Unlike VS Zappos sells many brands on their site and have to find a unified way of presenting them on the page. While they do target a customer in mind, their customer base is more diverse. Their left hand navigation targets visitors by age and gender. While the header navigation targets shopping items along gender and age. <br />
There is a slideshow that showcases the top options for shoppers who could be male, female or children looking for anything from clothes to shoes to sun glasses. Zappos is traditionally known for shoes, so the bottom half of their homepage is devoted to shoes. With a secondary navigation for men/women/child shoes.
In secondary pages Zappos provides a grid view of the items their selling.  They keep the navigation in the header and side bar and allow their users to navigate back home with their upper left hand logo, clearly visible throughout.
