<span style="title">Some of my favorite sites:</span>
<ul><li>The New York Times</li>
<li>Zappos.com</li>
<li>Victoriassecret.com</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p> A website that consistently provides excellent design and thoughtful layout is the New York Times. The layout is sophisticated considering the heavy information load it must relay to the visitor, it's no easy task. Yet, their homepage is laden with  teaser links that take visitors to their desired article.</p><br />
<p>The New York Times homepage is nothing more than links to articles but they do it in a light way, allowing the eye to glide over the headlines and pick an interesting keyword. They showcase a major news development in the upper left corner and provide a big photo or photo/slideshow for a secondary major article. The top of the page is devoted to the most <span class="ital">topical</span> news developments of the past 24 hours such as: Op-Ed, breaking news, investigative pieces.
</p><br />
<p>In addition to the top of the page bearing the most pressing news of the hour/day, they neatly place thumbnails next to articles on such topics as food, health, theater and politics. At times they'll provide a custom made NYT icon instead of a picture. I love their icons as well.
</p>
<br />
<p>Interestingly, the Huffington Post provides similar content and yet, I find the HuffPo to be messy and chaotic and at times even a bit <span class="ital">shouty</span>. Whereas the NYT is black text on white background, unified in its look, fonts, thumbnail sizes with thoughtful layout that varies in size. It's a website I visit on multiple occasions a day. It's a website that has undergone design changes, keeping up with design trends. </p>
<br />
<p>Navigating the New York Times couldn't be easier, the links are very obvious and the logo at the top of the page remains consistent throughout the pages and is always linked to the homepage. You are never lost, not with the home logo link and the breadcrumbs at the top of the inner pages.</p>
<br />
<p>Their site is very uplifting, navigating to other articles is very easy. A visitor could spend +hour on the site going from article to article.</p>
<br />
The NYT sells ad space which is tastefully placed either on the very top or on the right hand side of the page. At times they will place ads at the very top of the page that can be easily minimized and exited. There is also a nice search feature on the homepage. It's like a mini-Google, however, NYT links will only search under the NYT domain.</p>
<br />
<p>NYT sells a subscription, but if you read less than 10 articles a month it's free. I used to subscribe.</p>
