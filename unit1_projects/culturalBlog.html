<p>RE: The Culture at DBC- I'm definitely starting to feel by this challenge that the culture at DBC is one of work and co-operation. Students must first do the work, then turn to others for help. The work comes from DBC's resources, but also the web at large.</p>
<br />
<p>It also feels like the student at DBC must be independent to pursue their goals. It's not really a classroom setting at this point where a teacher assigns work to read and a homework assignment is prepared. It's more like a community billoboad telling students what subjects to cover on their own and just submit their assignments at the end of the week. A little vague, a little murky. My footing is uncertain, but I know that that support is just an email away from a cohort liason or a fellow student on Google+. So there is comfort in that.</p>
<br />
<p>RE: Kitchen Table approach to DBC, that's a novel way to look at anything in life. Removing the expectation of others providing every last detail and just going out of our way to make the challenge work, using every last resouce at our disposal. It's a very grown up approach and the opposite of school. Then again DBC is not a conventional school, it makes no mention of the word school anywhere in its title. It's a <span class="ital">Bootcamp</span>.</p>
<br />
<p>I am definitely more than a little nervous at this approach, it's <span class="ital">new</span>. It also makes me want to rise to meet the challenge. Not only have I already committed some finances to this boot camp, but I really want the end results it promises to developer:<span class="ital">World Class Beginner</span>!</p>
